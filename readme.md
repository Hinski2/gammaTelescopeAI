# My project about telescope

---

In this project I learned basic abut machine learning. To learn all this things I followed that tutorial: https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?si=KxnDz1s8330TMC1_

Data that I used is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope

---

## what I learned

- how to split data across: train, valid and test
- how to implemente techniques
- what is ai model

techniques:
- k-nearest nighbours
- naive bayes
- logistic regression
- svm
- neural network

But the most valuable thing that I learned is How much match, propability and statistic you must to know to program efficient AI (that is just pure propability). I hope that you can take some interesting things from my project.
